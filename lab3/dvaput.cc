/*
 * Gustav Carlsson (gusca083)
 * Time complexity O(nlog(n))
 * Memory complexity O(n)
 * Finds the longest substring appearing twice in a given string
 *
 *
 * This is done by taking the suffix of each position and then sorting them based on their
 * lexographical order. * At each iteration, the suffixes are compared using the first 2·µè characters.
 * If a suffix is shorter than that, -1 is returned as a placeholder,
 * indicating that the suffix has reached the end.
 * The vector that is returned from build_suffix_array contains
 * the starting positions of these sorted suffixes.
 * The LCP array is built by comparing each suffix with the previous one in the sorted order.
 * We don't need to compare with other since the suffix array is sorted in lexographicall order:
 * For each pair of consecutive suffixes, we find how many characters they share in common from the start.
 * If a suffix is shorter than the other, we stop the comparison and move to the next pair.
 * The length of the overlap is stored in the array, and the highest value in the LCP array is the length of the longest repeated substring.
